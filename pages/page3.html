            <h4>Why the Islands Formed Into a Chain</h4>
        </header>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Because of this phenominon, the number of islands in the island chain has been increasing over the past 100 million years. Over-time, as islands drift away from the hot-spot, they become dormant and start to erode, resulting in older islands being alot smaller than the newer ones. Another factor that contributed to a difference in the size of islands is because of change in the rate at which the Pacific Plate moves, which can fluctuate over time. This results in some volcanos forming closer to each other, creating larger islands. </p>
